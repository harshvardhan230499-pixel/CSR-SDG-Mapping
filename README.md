# CSR-SDG-Mapping
Power BI dashboard mapping CSR expenditure (2018–2020) to SDG index scores (2018–2020) for Indian States
The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a national priority for India, with the government aligning policy and planning to these targets through the NITI Aayog SDG Index. Achieving these ambitious goals requires collaboration beyond government — and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has emerged as a key enabler.
Since the Companies Act, 2013 mandated CSR spending, Indian companies collectively contribute thousands of crores annually to education, health, livelihoods, environment, and other developmental areas. But the impact of this expenditure depends on how well it is aligned with SDG priorities.
That’s where this dashboard comes in.
 What the Dashboard Does?
Maps CSR spending (2018–2020) to SDG scores (2018–2020) at a state level.
Lets users filter by state, year, or level (national vs state).
Shows where CSR funding is concentrated and whether states with higher spending are showing higher SDG performance.
Why This Is Important?
For NGOs: Helps identify funding-rich but low-SDG states, where NGOs can propose stronger interventions and partnerships.
For Corporates/CSR Teams: Provides a data-backed lens to prioritize projects, ensuring CSR budgets create maximum SDG impact.
Limitations:
SDG data is not available for 2021 and 2022.
CSR data is reported by companies and may have inconsistencies.
The dashboard currently uses state-level aggregates, not district-level CSR spend. 
Key highlights:
CSR expenditure aggregated at state level per year.
SDG index values averaged for states to create Avg_sdg_score.
Scatterplots designed to visualize CSR (x-axis) vs SDG score (y-axis).
Geo-map used to indicate CSR amount concentration by state.
